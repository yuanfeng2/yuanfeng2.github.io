## Tinder-like Swiping Animation

Tinder like animation was applied to the main screens when user is swiping the cards. This enabled smooth viewing and swiping experience. I researched and found shared-element-transition was supported in React Native for image transition. Location and filter functions are located on left-top and right-top of the screen, where you could re-locate your postion and pick type of cuisines and ratings for more accurate feeds. In the middle part of screen, you could switch to your like history and review your past selections.

## TF-IDF Algorithms

TF-IDF (term frequencyâ€“inverse document frequency) is essentially an vector written by hand, and then we can calculate the similarity between vectors. In my case, the vector is the restaurant, and the keywords are the menu items. Content based filtering was conducted by recommending restaurants similar to user favorite restaurants.
